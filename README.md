üß† How It Works
The Legal Document Sentiment Analysis tool employs a multi-model approach:

1. Text Preprocessing
Cleans and normalizes legal document text
Handles document length limitations (512 tokens max)
2. Sentiment Analysis Pipeline
Primary Model: RoBERTa (Twitter-based sentiment analysis)
Legal Model: FinBERT (Financial/Legal domain-specific analysis)
Fallback: BERT Multilingual model for enhanced coverage
3. Risk Assessment Algorithm
High Risk: Negative sentiment in both models with confidence > 80%
Medium Risk: Negative sentiment in one model or moderate confidence (60-80%)
Low Risk: Positive/neutral sentiment with acceptable confidence levels
4. Visualization Engine
Interactive charts using Plotly
Sentiment distribution pie charts
Risk level bar charts
Confidence score histograms
